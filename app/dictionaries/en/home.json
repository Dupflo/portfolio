		"description": "I'm a 27-year-old freelance web developer. I've been coding for over 10 years, and I love exploring new technologies in the digital realm, particularly within the web sphere. I've developed a strong interest in both Front-End and Back-End web development, with JavaScript being my specialty. I am well experimented on Next.js projects which is my favorite framework. I'm also proficient in the PHP language, and I have extensive experience with CMS platforms such as WordPress and PrestaShop.\n\nI enjoy traveling the world while simultaneously writing lines of code. I've spent 3 years in the United States, 2 years in Canada, and currently reside in France. I'm a soccer lover and enjoy listening to rock music. I have an athletic background by playing soccer in semi-professional level in France and playing during 3 years in the United States.\n\nI've worked extensively as a freelance developer, and in 2023, I founded a digital agency called Anywwwhere. For over three years now, I've been working with Paris Airports, assisting them in their digital transformation by developing innovative functionalities and projects using cutting-edge technologies through Extime.com.",
