# TenderCulture - Library MVP

This project was particularly satisfying as it marked my first time using Tailwind UI. As we reflect on this project, I had already been working on Poddium for a couple of months. During this time, I found that our production process was too cumbersome for just two developers and one product owner. Our product owner, <Link href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/germainchittaro" target="_blank">Germain Chittaro</Link>, consistently produced fantastic designs, but occasionally, the font sizes or margins were not precise. From my perspective, his focus seemed overly centered on graphic details, which, while excellent, often resulted in longer development and shipping times.

Therefore, I proposed that he continue creating outstanding mockups but suggested that he begin by using the Tailwind UI library components as a starting point and then adapt them to his graphic ideas.

## Our stack for this project

<Stack data={["nextjs", "tailwindcss", "tailwindui", "strapi", "vercel"]} />

Germain did a great job by designing the TenderCulture Library and helping me identify the inspired components on Tailwind UI. It only took me two months of part-time work to deliver the MVP.

On my side, I did my best to implement best practices for reusing components.

For example, let's see if you recognize this **seller block** on the homepage?

<Image src={SellerBlock} width={900} />

It's a variation of <Link href="https://tailwindui.com/components/marketing/sections/feature-sections#component-11e5dbce11b8c462441792503ea864fc" target="_blank" class="underline">this Tailwind UI component</Link>.

And this is how I worked on improving its reusability with NextJS 14.

What do you think ? I added <code>reverse</code> props just to switch the sides and apply the same component above or below.

The overall app is based on these principles, using this approach to build components.
