				<p>
					Because to me, you are the final boss. I am always striving to push myself to a deeper level, looking for how I can improve a project and how I can become a better developer. I&apos;ve thoroughly enjoyed my three years of
					experience at ADP, which I consider the best professional experience I&apos;ve had in my career so far. While working there, I&apos;ve been involved in both frontend and backend development, utilizing awesome technologies such as
					Next.js, Strapi, Tailwind UI, and others. However, for the first time in my life, I find myself wanting to be behind the scenes and study how everything works.
				</p>
				<p>
					I aspire to become a great developer, teacher, publishing great posts on platforms like X and Medium, and making amazing pull requests for the developer community. I admire those who take the time to do so because I would love to
					offer similar contributions. The truth is, I often find myself too focused on my own projects and clients, neglecting to share my knowledge and experiences with others. But when I am doing it with my young developer or YouTube
					company, I always have a good feedback from them, so I feel I have something to do. This is an aspect that I hope to improve upon, and it&apos;s one of the reasons why I&apos;m interested in joining Tailwind Labs .
				</p>
				<p>
					Much like my YouTube channel, I would love to do more, but I find myself caught in a continuous cycle of development for my clients, not allocating enough time for personal growth and community contributions. I have so much left
					to learn, and I hope you can give me the opportunity to reach the next step and become a great developer and contributor to the developer community.
				</p>
				<p>Thank you for considering me.</p>
